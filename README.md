# Coursera_Capstone
This is the final course on Coursera.com, Applied Data Science Capstone.
This Project includes five assigments and all them will make a whole project.

1. Write some markdown to explain that this notebook will be mainly used for the capstone project.
2. Import the pandas library as pd.
3. Import the Numpy library as np.
4. Print the following the statement: Hello Capstone Project Course!

Push the Notebook to your Github repository and submit a link to the notebook on your Github repository.
